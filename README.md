# LSTM
Long Short Term Neural network that grabs data from internet for stock prices and trains a new neural network that at the end throws a prediction for next day's closing price of the stock market.  Wildly inaccurate but was a cool experience figuring out artificial intelligence in python.
To see this baby in action I recommend installing anaconda for python 2 on the machine and have alot of patience as neural networks take a long time to train.
